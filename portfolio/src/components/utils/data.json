I worked alone on the design and research to pitch the vision and execution phases. Additionally, I coded the landing page in html css and with a little bit of javascript. Home Made By Sophie (HMBS) is a little shop founded in by Sophie Gartier, with the mission to bring a change to unethical and ecological problems in the beauty market. The products are  all organic, and it had to feel like what it is actually. The Real Problem here was to reassure the costumer, who is more and more losing trust because companies lack of ethics",
