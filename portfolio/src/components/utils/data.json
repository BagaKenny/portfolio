       "During my end of year project, we were mandated to think and create an editorial support with the theme of 'Hors-Champ' Outer Sight, How to visualize phenomena which we know exist, but which remain imperceptible until now: Black holes, Dark matter, gravitational wave, Oort cloud, Exoplanets, Planck's wall, primitive radiation? Our eyes do not give us all the information, they are limited and highly dependent on light. But what if we want to understand the activity of sounds, surprising phenomena that we cannot see but exist?This was the basis of my design thinking through this project",

I worked alone on the design and research to pitch the vision and execution phases. Additionally, I coded the landing page in html css and with a little bit of javascript. Home Made By Sophie (HMBS) is a little shop founded in by Sophie Gartier, with the mission to bring a change to unethical and ecological problems in the beauty market. The products are  all organic, and it had to feel like what it is actually. The Real Problem here was to reassure the costumer, who is more and more losing trust because companies lack of ethics",
